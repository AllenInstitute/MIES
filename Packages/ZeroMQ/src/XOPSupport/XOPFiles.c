	A simple implementation of this routine would merely search for colon or
	backslash characters. However, this simple approach causes problems on Asian
	systems that use two-byte characters. The problem is that the second byte of
	a two-byte character may have the same code as a colon or backslash, causing
	the simple implementation to mistakenly take it for a path separator.
	
	GetDirectoryAndFileNameFromFullPath takes a more complex approach to avoid
	this problem. To achieve this, the routine has to know the character encoding
	governing the fullFilePath parameter. GetDirectoryAndFileNameFromFullPath assumes
	that the system default character encoding governs the fullFilePath parameter.

	It may use Macintosh or Windows path conventions.
	
	fullFilePath is an output and will contain the full path to the file referenced
	by symbolicPathName and filePath. The returned path will use Macintosh path
	conventions on Macintosh and Windows path conventions on Windows.
	
	This routine is used by file loader XOPs to get a full path to a file based
	on the typical inputs to a file loader, namely an optional Igor symbolic path
	and an optional full or partial file path or file name.
	
	The two most common cases are:
		LoadWave <full path to file>
		LoadWave/P=<symbolic path name> <file name>
		
	where <file name> conotes a simple file name.
	
	Less common cases that this routine also handles are:
		LoadWave/P=<symbolic path name> <full path to file>		// Symbolic path is ignored.
		LoadWave/P=<symbolic path name> <partial path to file>
	
	In the following cases, the full path to the file can not be determined,
	so GetFullPathFromSymbolicPathAndFilePath returns an error. This would cause
	a file loader to display an open file dialog:
		LoadWave <file name>
		LoadWave <partial path to file>
	
	filePath and fullFilePath may point to the same storage, in which case the
	output string will overwrite the input string.
	
	This routine does not check that the output path is valid or points to an existing
	file. This makes the routine useable for applications in which you are creating the
	file as well as applications in which you are reading the file. If you want to verify
	that the output path points to an existing file, use the FullPathPointsToFile routine.
	
	Returns 0 if it was able to create the full path or an error code if not.
