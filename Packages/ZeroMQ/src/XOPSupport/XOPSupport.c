	as an escape character.
	
	For example, if you are generating a file loading command and the file uses a Windows

/*	ConvertTextEncoding(source, numSourceBytes, sourceTextEncoding, dest, destBufSizeInBytes, destTextEncoding, errorMode, options, numOutputBytesPtr)

	Converts text from one text encoding to another.
	
	See the documentation on text encodings in the XOP Toolkit 7 manual for background information about
	text encodings and how they are handled in Igor.
	
	This routine uses ints for numSourceBytes and destBufSizeInBytes and thus the input text and the
	output buffer size must not exceed roughly 2 billion bytes.
	
	source points to the input text for the conversion.
	
	numSourceBytes is the number of bytes of source text.
	
	sourceTextEncoding is a value of type WMTextEncodingCode - an enum defined in IgorXOP.h.
	
	dest is the output buffer where converted data is stored. dest and source must not point
	to the same memory.
	
	destBufSizeInBytes is the size of the output buffer in bytes. The number of bytes required
	depends on sourceTextEncoding and destTextEncoding. If destTextEncoding is kWMTextEncodingUTF8
	then the output buffer, in the worst case, needs to be 6*numSourceBytes if errorMode is
	kWMTextEncodingConversionErrorModeEscape or 4*numSourceBytes otherwise. This is because
	a single input character requires, in the worst case, up to 4 bytes in UTF-8.
	Also if errorMode is kWMTextEncodingConversionErrorModeEscape then the conversion will replace
	an unmappable input character with an escape sequence consisting of up to 6 bytes. The simplest
	solution is to always allocate an output buffer of size 6*numSourceBytes. If you are converting
	very large chunks of source text you should use a smaller output buffer size chosen based on
	sourceTextEncoding and destTextEncoding.
	
	destTextEncoding is a value of type WMTextEncodingCode - an enum defined in IgorXOP.h.
	
	errorMode is a value defined by the WMTextEncodingConversionErrorMode type - an enum defined
	in IgorXOP.h. errorMode determines what happens if the source text can not be mapped to text
	in the text encoding specified by destTextEncoding. See the WMTextEncodingConversionErrorMode
	definition for details. For most purposes you should pass kWMTextEncodingConversionErrorModeFail
	for errorMode. This causes ConvertTextEncoding to return an error if the source text can
	not be mapped to the destination text encoding.
	
	The number of bytes in the converted output text is stored in *numOutputBytesPtr.
	
	options is a bitwise combination of WMTextEncodingConversionOptionFlag values as defined
	in IgorXOP.h. Typically you should form this parameter like this:
		WMTextEncodingConversionOptions tecOptions = kTECOptionFlagDontAllowNulls;
		tecOptions |= kTECOptionFlagDoConversionEvenIfEncodingsAreTheSame;

	kTECOptionFlagDontAllowNulls causes ConvertTextEncoding to return an error if the input
	text contains nulls. Normally you don't want nulls in text but if for some reason you do,
	pass kTECOptionFlagAllowNulls instead of kTECOptionFlagDontAllowNulls.
	
	kTECOptionFlagDoConversionEvenIfEncodingsAreTheSame forces ConvertTextEncoding to do the
	conversion even if sourceTextEncoding and destTextEncoding are the same. This is useful
	to validate that the source text is in fact valid text in the specified source text encoding.
	If you know that the source text is valid, you can omit kTECOptionFlagDoConversionEvenIfEncodingsAreTheSame.
	In this case, if sourceTextEncoding and destTextEncoding are the same, ConvertTextEncoding
	merely copies the source text to the destination buffer without doing any validation.
		
	The function result is 0 if OK or a non-zero error code.
	
	Added in Igor Pro 7.00. If you call this when running with an earlier version it will return
	IGOR_OBSOLETE and do nothing.
	
	Thread Safety: ConvertTextEncoding is Igor-thread-safe with XOP Toolkit 7 and Igor Pro 7.00 or later.
	You can call it from a thread created by Igor but not from a private thread that you created yourself.

	Carbon Copy notebook. If you are not using the History Carbon Copy feature (added in Igor Pro
	6.10B04), use XOPNotice instead of XOPNotice3.
		
	noticePtr is a C string (null byte at the end).
	Typically notices should be terminated by carriage return (use CR_STR at end of string as shown below).
	
	rulerName is the name of a ruler in the History Carbon Copy notebook.
	XOPNotice3 applies the ruler to the current selection in the History Carbon Copy notebook
	before inserting the text. If rulerName is "" then the ruler is not changed.
	
	options is defined as follows:
		Bit 0:
			If set, the history carbon copy ruler is restored after the text is inserted.
			If cleared, the history carbon copy ruler is not restored.
		
		All other bits are reserved and must be passed as zero.
	
	Typically you would call this to use a ruler that you previously created in the history
	carbon copy notebook to control formatting for specific kinds of notices. For example, if
	you created a ruler named Warning, you would send a warning to the history like this:
	
		XOPNotice3("You have been warned!" CR_STR, "Warning", 1);
		
	Bit 0 of options should be set except in the case when you expect to make many calls to
	XOPNotice3 in a row. In this case, you can make it run slightly faster like this:
	
		XOPNotice3("Starting", "Progress", 0);		// Starting a long process
		XOPNotice3(" .", "", 0);					// Add a dot to indicate progress
		. . .
		XOPNotice3(" .", "", 0);					// Add a dot to indicate progress
		XOPNotice3("Done!" CR_STR, "", 0);			// The long process is done
		XOPNotice3("", "Normal", 0);				// Restore normal ruler
		
	In this example, we set the history carbon copy ruler to "Progress" which is the name
	of a ruler that we created for paragraphs containing progress messages. We then called
	XOPNotice3 repeatedly to add a dot to the progress message. In these calls, we specified
	no ruler so the ruler is not changed. At the end, we add a carriage return (CR_STR) to
	make sure we are on a new paragraph and then set the ruler to Normal so that normal
	history carbon copy processing will occur in the future.
	
	Added in Igor Pro 6.10B04. If you call this when running with an earlier version,
	nothing will be sent to the history.

	Igor Pro allows wave and data folder names to contain characters,

	CleanupName changes it, if necessary, to make it a legal name.

	On input, name may be longer than maxNameBytes bytes. On output, it is

	For most uses, pass MAX_OBJ_NAME for the maxNameBytes parameter.

	Igor Pro allows wave and data folder names to contain characters,
	such as space and dot, that were previously illegal in names. We call this

	If beLiberal is non-zero, CleanupName uses liberal name rules. Liberal rules are still not

	If you are going to use the name in Igor's command line (via an Execute operation
	or via the XOPCommand or XOPSilentCommand callbacks), and if the name uses liberal
	rules, the name may need to be single-quoted. In these cases, you should call
	PossiblyQuoteName after calling CleanupName.

/*	CreateValidDataObjectName(...)
	
	This routine is designed to do all of the nasty work needed to get
	a legal name for a given object. It cleans up illegal names and resolves
	name conflicts.

	It returns in outName a name that can be safely used to create a data object
	of a given type (wave, string, variable, numeric variable).
	
	inName is the proposed name for the object.

	outName is the name after possible cleanup and uniquification.
	
	suffixNumPtr is used to speed up the search for unique names.
	See UniqueName2 for details.
	
	dataFolderH is a handle to a data folder or NULL to use the current data folder.
	
	objectType is one of the following:
		WAVE_OBJECT, VAR_OBJECT, STR_OBJECT, DATAFOLDER_OBJECT.

	beLiberal is 1 if you want to allow liberal names or 0 if not.

	allowOverwrite is 1 if it is OK to for outName to be the name of an
	existing object of the same type.
	
	inNameIsBaseName is 1 if inName is a base name (e.g., "wave") to which a
	suffix (e.g., "0") must always be added to produce the actual name (e.g., "wave0").
	If inNameIsBaseName is 0, then no suffix will be added to inName unless it
	is needed to make the name unique.
	
	printMessage is 1 if you want CreateValidDataObjectName to print a message
	in Igor's history area if an unexpected name conflict occurs. A message is
	printed if you are not using a base name and not allowing overwriting and
	there is a name conflict. A message is also printed if a conflict with
	an object of a different type prevents the normal name from being used.
	
	CreateValidDataObjectName sets *nameChangedPtr to the truth that outName
	is different from inName.
	
	It sets *doOverwritePtr to 1 if outName is the name of an existing object
	of the same type and allowOverwrite is 1.
	
	inName and outName can point to the same array if you don't want to
	preserve the original name. Both must be big enough to hold MAX_OBJ_NAME+1 bytes.
	
	If the object type is VAR_OBJECT or STR_OBJECT, the name will not be
	liberal, even if beLiberal is 1. Igor allows only wave and data folder
	names to be liberal.
	
	Returns 0 if OK or an error code.
	
	Thread Safety: CreateValidDataObjectName is Igor-thread-safe with XOP Toolkit 6 and Igor Pro 6.20 or later.
	You can call it from a thread created by Igor but not from a private thread that you created yourself.

	startColorIndex and endColorIndex specify the indices of the colors for

	The IgorColorSpec structure contains an RGBColor field which identifies the

	The value field of the IgorColorSpec structure tells you the pixel value that

	the screen when the monitor is in 16 or 256 color mode. It is typically used by
	advanced programmers who are writing directly to offscreen bitmap memory. 
	
	However, when a monitor is running in 16 or 256 color mode, this value is
	invalidated whenever the system changes the hardware color lookup table, which
	can happen at any time. If you pass non-zero for the updateVals parameter, then
	Igor will update the value field for each color before returning it to you and
	it will be accurate until the next time the system changes the hardware color
	lookup table. If you pass zero for the updateVals parameter, then Igor will not
	update the value field and it is likely to be stale. 
	
	Updating the value fields takes time so you should pass non-zero for the
	updateVals parameter only if you really need accurate pixel values. For
	example, if you just want to know what RGB colors appear in a particular color
	table then you don't need the pixel values and should pass 0 for the updateVals
	parameter. On the other hand, if you are writing into an offscreen bitmap in
	preparation for blasting it to the screen, then you need accurate pixel values
	and you should pass 1 for updateVals.

		'DIB '			Windows only
		'EMF '			Windows only
		'JPEG'
		'PDF '
		'PNGf'

		Bit 0:			If cleared, XOPSetClipboardData clears the clipboard before storing data.
						If set, it does not clear the clipboard.
	All other bits are reserved for future use and must be cleared.

	In most cases, you should pass 0 for options. This causes XOPSetClipboardData to clear
	the clipboard and then store your data in it. If bit 0 is set, XOPSetClipboardData does
	not clear the clipboard and you may wind up with multiple types of data in the clipboard.
	
	data points to the data to be stored in the clipboard.
	
	length is the number of bytes to be stored in the clipboard.
	
	On Windows, setting the clipboard via multiple successive calls can cause errors because
	programs that monitor the clipboard to open it to inspect its contents each time it is
	changed. This causes Windows to return an error when Igor tries to open the clipboard.
	Repeatedly calling XOPSetClipboardData to store multiple formats on the clipboard may
	trigger this problem on some systems and therefore is not recommended.
	
	XOPSetClipboardData returns 0 in the event of success or a non-zero Igor error code.

	XOPSetClipboardData was added in Igor Pro 7.00. If you call it while running an earlier
	version of Igor, it returns IGOR_OBSOLETE and does nothing.

	If it is not found, Igor then searches all Igor native help files in the folder
	containing the XOP file and subfolders. If it is still not found Igor then
	searches all Igor native help files in the Igor Pro folder and subfolders.
	
	The help file must be compiled in order for Igor to find the topic. Each time
	you open a file as a help file, Igor checks to see if it is compiled and if
	not asks if you want to compile it.
	
	topicStr may have one of the following formats:
		Format							Example
		<topic name>					"GBLoadWave XOP"
		<subtopic name>					"The Load General Binary Dialog"
		<topic name>[<subtopic name>]	"GBLoadWave XOP[The Load General Binary Dialog]"
		
	If the topic that you want to display is a subtopic, you should use the last
	form since it minimizes the chance that Igor will find another help file with
	the same subtopic name. Also, you must choose descriptive topic and
	subtopic names to minimize the chance of a conflict between two help files.
	
	Note that once you reference a help topic or subtopic from your executable code,
	you must be careful to avoid changing the name of the topic or subtopic.
	
	The title parameter is used only for modal help and supplies the title for
	a modal dialog containing the help.
	
	The flags parameter is interpreted bitwise as follows:
		Bit 0			If cleared, Igor displays non-modal help.
						If set, Igor displays modal help.						
						
		Bit 1			If cleared, during modal help Igor displays the entire
						help file (if it is not too big) in the modal help dialog,
						with the specified topic initially in view. If set, during
						modal help Igor displays just the specified topic.
						
		Bit 2			If cleared, if the topic can not be found Igor displays an error
						dialog. If set, if the topic can not be found Igor does not display
						an error dialog.
						
		All other bits	Reserved - set to zero.
						
	You MUST set bit 0 if you call XOPDisplayHelpTopic from a modal dialog. This causes
	Igor do display a dialog containing help on top of your dialog. If you fail to set
	bit zero when calling XOPDisplayHelpTopic from a modal dialog, Igor may behave erratically.
	Unfortunately, links in help files don't work during modal help.
	
	If you are calling XOPDisplayHelpTopic in a non-modal situation, it is appropriate to
	clear bit zero, but not required. If you clear bit zero, Igor displays a normal
	Igor help file. If you set bit zero, Igor displays a modal help dialog.
	
	You must set all other bits to zero.

	Function result is 0 if OK or IGOR_OBSOLETE if you are running with an older

	It is intended to be called in response to a user action, such as when a user

	SetIgorProcedure stores the procedure text, which is contained in the handle

	You must make sure that procedureName agrees with the name of the procedure
	as found in the handle. Otherwise, Igor may be left in an unstable state.
	For example, if the text in h is this:

			Print "Hello World"
		End

		Bit 0:	Set if the text in the handle is a macro (defined by the keywords
				Macro, Proc or Window).
				
		Bit 1:	Set if the text in the handle is a function (defined by the keyword
				Function).
				
		Bit 2:	If cleared and if there is already a procedure with the same name,
				SetIgorProcedure will return an error. If set and if there is
				already a procedure with the same name, SetIgorProcedure will
				replace the existing procedure and return 0.
		
		All other bits are reserved for future use and must be set to 0.

		1		Text is a macro. Return error if conflict.
		2		Text is a function. Return error if conflict.
		5		Text is a macro. Overwrite existing procedure if conflict.
		6		Text is a function. Overwrite existing procedure if conflict.
		
	The flags parameter must be consistent with the text in the handle. For example,
	you must not pass 1 for flags if the text in the handle is a function.
	
	SetIgorProcedure normally stores the procedure in the built-in Procedure window.
	However, if there already exists a procedure with the specified name and if
	that procedure is in another procedure window, SetIgorProcedure stores the
	procedure in that procedure window.
	
	After storing the procedure in the procedure window, SetIgorProcedure causes
	the Igor procedure windows to be compiled if auto-compile is on. If auto-compile
	is off, then the user must cause procedures to be compiled by choosing Compile
	from the Macros menu. Because of this, an XOP can not depend on the procedure
	being available for execution as soon as SetIgorProcedure returns. There is
	currently no way for the XOP to know the state of the auto-compile setting.
	
	SetIgorProcedure returns 0 if it successfully stores the text in a procedure
	window. Otherwise, it returns a non-zero error code.
	
	SetIgorProcedure returns a non-zero error code in the following cases:

	1. SetIgorProcedure was called while Igor was compiling procedures.
	   This could happen only  under weird recursion circumstances.
	   SetIgorProcedure returns -1 in this case.
	   
	2. SetIgorProcedure was called while Igor was running a macro or function.
	   Igor can not change procedures while they are running because this could
	   cause a crash. SetIgorProcedure returns -1 in this case.
	   
	3. Igor can not store the text because a serious syntax error in the
	   procedure windows prevents it from successfully scanning the procedures.
	   In this case, SetIgorProcedure returns NEED_COMPILE.
	  
	4. procedureName is not a valid name (too long or contains bad characters).
	
	5. procedureName is in conflict with a built-in or external operation or function
	   or a wave or a variable. The error returned depends on the type of object
	   that is in conflict.
	
	6. procedureName is in conflict with a macro or user function and bit 2 of
	   flags is not set. SetIgorProcedure returns NAME_MAC_CONFLICT or
	   NAME_USER_FUNC_CONFLICT.
	
	7. SetIgorProcedure ran out of memory. In this case, SetIgorProcedure returns NOMEM.
	
	8. You are doing a replace and the procedure window containing the original
	   procedure is open for read-only. In this case, you will receive a non-zero
	   error code. If the procedure window is open for read/write but the write-protect
	   icon is on, SetIgorProcedure will replace the procedure and return 0. The write-
	   protect icon is intended only to prevent inadvertent manual changes.
	
	Future versions of SetIgorProcedure may return other error codes so your
	XOP should not crash or otherwise grossly misbehave if it receives some
	other error code.
	
	Thread Safety: SetIgorProcedure is not thread-safe.

/*	GetFunctionInfo(name, fip)

	Returns information that you need in order to call an Igor user function
	or an external function from an XOP. This is an advanced feature that most
	XOP programmers will not need.
	
	name is the name of an existing user or external function. If there is no such
	function, GetFunctionInfo returns an error. If the function is a user function
	and procedures are not in a compiled state, GetFunctionInfo returns an
	error. If everything is OK, GetFunctionInfo returns zero.
	
	When you call GetFunctionInfo with a simple function name, such as "MyFunction",
	the information returned describes the named function in the currently-executing
	independent module. If you call GetFunctionInfo with a fully-qualified name,
	such as "ProcGlobal#MyFunction" or "MyModule#MyFunction", the information returned
	describes the named function in the named module. So if you want to call from one
	independent module to another using CallFunction, you must use fully-qualified
	names when calling GetFunctionInfo. If you want to call a function in the built-in
	ProcGlobal module, it is a good idea to specify it in the function name. See
	"CallFunction and Igor Independent Modules" in the XOP Toolkit manual for an example.
	
	The information returned by GetFunctionInfo should be used and then discarded.
	If the user does anything to cause procedures to be compiled then the values
	returned by GetFunctionInfo are no longer valid.
	
	GetFunctionInfo returns via fip->compilationIndex a value that you will
	pass to CallFunction. This value is used to make sure that procedures
	have not been changed between the time you call GetFunctionInfo and
	the time you call CallFunction.
	
	GetFunctionInfo returns via fip->functionID a value which you will pass to
	CallFunction to specify which user function you want to execute.
	
	GetFunctionInfo returns via fip->subType a code that identifies certain
	special purpose functions. The value returned currently has no use but may
	be used in the future.
	
	GetFunctionInfo returns via fip->isExternalFunction a value that is non-zero
	for external functions and zero for user functions. This field is for your
	information only. Your code will be the same for external and user functions.
	
	GetFunctionInfo returns via fip->returnType one of the following codes:
		NT_FP64:			Return value is a double-precision number
		NT_FP64 | NT_CMPLX:	Return value is a complex double-precision number
		HSTRING_TYPE:		Return value is a string
		WAVE_TYPE:			Return value is a wave reference (Igor Pro 6.10 or later)
		DATAFOLDER_TYPE:	Return value is a DFREF (Igor Pro 6.10 or later)
	
	GetFunctionInfo returns via fip->numOptionalParameters, fip->numRequiredParameters
	and fip->totalNumParameters the number of optional, required and total parameters for
	the function. Currently, an XOP can call a user function that has optional parameters
	but the XOP can not pass optional parameters to the function. In other words, it
	must pass the required parameters only.
	
	GetFunctionInfo returns via fip->parameterTypes an array of parameter types.
	GetFunctionInfo stores a parameter type value in elements 0 through fip->totalNumParameters-1.
	Elements fip->totalNumParameters and higher are undefined so you must not use them.
	
	You must use the CheckFunctionForm XOPSupport routine to make sure that the
	function is of the form you want. You normally don't need to examine the parameter
	type values directly, but in case you are curious, here is how a parameter type value
	is defined:
		if (parameterType == NT_FP64)
			Parameter is a double-precision number
			
		if (parameterType == (NT_FP64 | NT_CMPLX))
			Parameter is a complex double-precision number
		
		if (parameterType == HSTRING_TYPE)
			Parameter is a string

		if (parameterType == FV_FUNC_TYPE)
			Parameter is a function reference
		
		if (WAVE_TYPE bit is set) {
			Parameter is a numeric or text wave
			if (WAVE_Z_TYPE bit is set)
				Wave declared with /Z flag (used only by Igor debugger)
			
			if (parameterType & 0x01) {
				Parameter is a complex numeric wave
			}
			else {
				if (isExternalFunction) {
					Parameter is a numeric or text wave (can't tell which till runtime)
				}
				else {
					if ((parameterType & 0xFE) == 0)
						Parameter is a text wave
					else
						Parameter is a numeric wave
				}
			
			}
		}
		
		if (DATAFOLDER_TYPE bit is set)
			Parameter is a DFREF
	
	In addition, the parameter type values for numeric, complex numeric and string
	parameters may be ORed with FV_REF_TYPE. This indicates that the corresponding
	parameter is "pass-by-reference", meaning that the function can change the
	value of that parameter.
	
	Thread Safety: GetFunctionInfo is Igor-thread-safe with XOP Toolkit 6 and Igor Pro 6.20 or later.
	You can call it from a thread created by Igor but not from a private thread that you created yourself.
	The FunctionInfo structure contains an isThreadSafe field which tells you if
	the function in question is threadsafe.

	Checks the form (number of parameters, types of parameters and return type) of the function
	against the required form.  This is an advanced feature that most XOP programmers will not need.
	
	You must call CheckFunctionForm before calling CallFunction to make sure that the function
	you are calling has the form you expect. Otherwise you may cause a crash.
	
	fip is pointer to a structure set by calling GetFunctionInfo.
	
	requiredNumParameters is the number of parameters you expect the function to have.
	
	requiredParameterTypes is an array in which you have set each value to one of the following:
		NT_FP64							The parameter must be scalar numeric
		NT_FP64 | NT_CMPLX				The parameter must be complex numeric
		HSTRING_TYPE					The parameter must be a string
		WAVE_TYPE						The parameter must be a scalar numeric wave
		WAVE_TYPE | NT_CMPLX			The parameter must be a complex numeric wave
		TEXT_WAVE_TYPE					The parameter must be a text wave
		DATAFOLDER_TYPE					The parameter must be a DFREF
		FV_FUNC_TYPE					The parameter must be a function reference
		FV_STRUCT_TYPE | FV_REF_TYPE	The parameter must be a structure

	DFREF parameters are supported in Igor Pro 6.10 or later.
		
	The number of elements in requiredParameterTypes must be at least equal to requiredNumParameters. 

	If the parameter must be pass-by-reference, use FV_REF_TYPE in addition to the
	values above. For example:
		NT_FP64 | FV_REF_TYPE
		NT_FP64 | NT_CMPLX | FV_REF_TYPE
		HSTRING_TYPE | FV_REF_TYPE
	
	Pass-by-reference is applicable to numeric and string parameters only.
	
	If you do not want CheckFunctionForm to check a particular parameter, pass
	-1 in the corresponding element of the requiredParameterTypes array.
	
	If the function is an external function, if the function takes a wave parameter,
	there is no way to know if the external function expects a numeric wave or a text wave.
	Consequently, CheckFunctionForm does not distinguish between numeric and text
	waves for external functions. The external function itself is supposed to check
	the type of the wave passed in at runtime and return an error if it is the
	wrong type.
	
	returnType is the required return type of the function which must be one of
	the following:
		NT_FP64
		NT_FP64 | NT_CMPLX
		HSTRING_TYPE
		WAVE_TYPE
		DATAFOLDER_TYPE
		
	Wave reference and DFREF return types are supported in Igor Pro 6.10 or later.

	If you do not want CheckFunctionForm to check the return type, pass -1
	as the returnType parameter.
	
	Sets *badParameterNumberPtr to the zero-based index of the first parameter that does
	not match the required type or to -1 if all parameters match the required type.
	
	Returns 0 if the form matches the requirements or an error code if not.
	
	If a function parameter type does not match the required parameter type, the error
	code returned will indicate the type of parameter required but not which parameter
	type was bad. If you want to inform the user more specifically, use the value returned
	via badParameterNumberPtr to select your own more specific error code. If the
	error was a parameter type mismatch, *badParameterNumberPtr will contain the
	zero-based index of the bad parameter. Otherwise, *badParameterNumberPtr will
	contain -1.

	fip is a pointer to a FunctionInfo structure whose values were set by calling GetFunctionInfo.
	
	fip->compilationIndex is used by CallFunction to make sure that procedures were

	parameters is a pointer to a structure containing the values that you want
	to pass to the function. These values must agree in type with the
	function's parameter list, as indicated by the parameter information that
	you obtain via GetFunctionInfo. To guarantee this, you must call CheckFunctionForm
	before calling CallFunction.
	
	NOTE: The parameters structure must use standard XOP structure packing, namely,
	two-byte packing. If you don't set the structure packing correctly, a crash
	is likely.
	
	Parameter type values are discussed in detail in the comments for the GetFunctionInfo
	function. Here is the basic correspondence between function parameter types and the
	respective structure field:
		if (parameterType == NT_FP64)
			structure field is double
			
		if (parameterType == (NT_FP64 | NT_CMPLX))
			structure field is double[2]
		
		if (parameterType == HSTRING_TYPE)

		if (DATAFOLDER_TYPE bit is set)			// Igor Pro 6.10 or later
			structure field is DataFolderHandle
		
		if (FV_FUNC_TYPE bit is set)
			structure field is PSInt
	
	NOTE: For pass-by-value strings parameters, ownership of a handle stored in
	the parameter structure is passed to the function when you call CallFunction.
	The function will dispose the handle and CallFunction will set the field
	to NULL. You must not dispose it or otherwise reference it after calling CallFunction.
	
	NOTE: For pass-by-reference string parameters, the handle stored in the parameter
	structure field may be reused or disposed by the called function. When
	CallFunction returns, you own the handle which may be the same handle
	you passed or a different handle. You own this handle and you must dispose
	it when you no longer need it. If the field is NULL, which could occur in the
	event of an error, you must not dispose of it or otherwise access it.
	
	CallFunction stores the function result at the location indicated by
	resultPtr. Here is the correspondence between the function result type and the
	variable pointed to by resultPtr:
		NT_FP64						double
		NT_FP64 | NT_CMPLX			double[2]
		HSTRING_TYPE				Handle
		WAVE_TYPE					waveHndl
		DATAFOLDER_TYPE				DataFolderHandle

	Wave reference and DFREF return types are supported in Igor Pro 6.10 or later.
		
	NOTE: A function that returns a string, wave or DataFolderHandle can return NULL
	instead of a valid handle. You must test the returned value to make sure it is not
	NULL before using it.
	
	NOTE: For string return values, if the returned handle is not NULL, you own it and
	you must dispose it when you no longer need it.

/*	GetOperationWaveRef(tp, dfH, name, waveRefIdentifier, destWaveHPtr)
	
	Returns via destWaveHPtr a reference to the destination wave if it was specified using
	a wave reference or NULL otherwise.

	Except in rare cases, you should not call this function. Use GetOperationDestWave instead.

	This routine supports the /DEST flag for an operation.

	If the destination wave was specified by passing a wave reference to /DEST,
	this routine returns the wave handle via destWaveHPtr.
	
	If the destination wave was not specified via a wave reference, this routine returns NULL
	via destWaveHPtr and you must create the destination wave yourself.
	
	The rule is: If a simple name or the name of a structure wave field are passed to /DEST,
	the specified wave is returned via destWaveHPtr. If $<string> or a path are passed to /DEST,
	NULL is returned. 
	
	Here are typical cases where a wave reference specifies the destination wave:
		SampleOp /DEST=jack	
		Wave w = root:jack
		SampleOp /DEST=w
	In these cases, GetOperationWaveRef would return a handle to wave jack via destWaveHPtr.
	In the first command, Operation Handler creates an automatic wave reference in the calling
	user-defined function if you are running Igor Pro 6.20 or later.
	
	Here are typical cases where a wave reference is not used to specify the destination wave:
		String name = "jack"
		SampleOp /DEST=$name		// Dest specified by $<string>
		SampleOp /DEST=root:jack	// Dest specified by path
		SampleOp /DEST=:jack		// Dest specified by path
	In these cases, there is no wave reference for the destination wave and
	GetOperationWaveRef would return NULL via destWaveHPtr.
	
	The user can specify that a wave reference be created by appending /WAVE after
	the /DEST flag, like this:
		String name = "jack"
		SampleOp /DEST=$name/WAVE=wDest
		SampleOp /DEST=root:jack/WAVE=wDest
		SampleOp /DEST=:jack/WAVE=wDest
	"/WAVE=wDest" is an "inline WAVE reference statement".
	An inline WAVE reference does not determine which wave is the destination wave but
	merely provides a place for the operation to return a reference to the destination wave.

	If a wave reference for the destination wave exists, it must be set to refer
	to the destination wave once that wave has been determined or created.
	You set the wave reference by calling SetOperationWaveRef later in the process.
	
	See GetOperationDestWave for an example.

/*	GetOperationDestWave(dfH, name, waveRefIdentifier, options, dimensionSizes, dataType, destWaveHPtr, destWaveCreatedPtr)

	Returns via destWaveHPtr a reference to the destination wave specified by the
	/DEST flag in an operation.

	GetOperationDestWave optionally creates the wave if it does not already exist. If the
	wave does exist, GetOperationDestWave changes it as specified by the options parameter.

	GetOperationDestWave is typically called to support the /DEST flag for an operation.
	It determines which wave is to be the destination wave, optionally creates it if
	it does not already exist, optionally overwrites it or sets its dimensions and
	data type if it does already exist, and returns the wave handle via destWaveHPtr.
	
	In Igor Pro 6.20 or later, GetOperationDestWave respects wave references
	passed as the destination wave when called from a user-defined function.

	If GetOperationDestWave succeeds, it returns 0 as the function result and
	a non-NULL wave handle via destWaveHPtr. If it fails it returns a non-zero error
	code as the function result and NULL via destWaveHPtr. Possible errors include
	NOMEM, NO_TEXTNUMERIC_WAVE_OVERWRITE, and NAME_WAV_CONFLICT (the destination wave
	already exists and overwrite is not specified).
	
	destWaveRefIdentifier is used by GetOperationDestWave to access a user-defined function
	local wave reference for the destination wave, if such a wave reference was specified
	with the /DEST flag. The example below shows how to obtain destWaveRefIdentifier from
	the operation's runtime parameter structure.
	
	The options parameter is a bitwise combination of the following flags:
		kOpDestWaveOverwriteOK:				Permits returning a pre-existing wave
		kOpDestWaveChangeExistingWave		Data type and dimensions of pre-existing wave will be changed
											but other properties (wave scaling, wave note) will be preserved
		kOpDestWaveOverwriteExistingWave	Pre-existing wave is overwritten
		kOpDestWaveMakeFreeWave				Dest wave will be a new free wave (requires Igor Pro 6.20 or later)
		kOpDestWaveMustAlreadyExist			Dest wave must already exist
	
	If kOpDestWaveOverwriteOK is set, the destination wave is returned if it
	already exists. If kOpDestWaveOverwriteOK is not set an error is returned
	if the destination wave already exists.
	
	If kOpDestWaveChangeExistingWave is set, if the destination wave already exists
	its dimensions and data type are changed based on the dimensionSizes and dataType
	parameters but other properties (wave scaling, wave note, etc.) are left unchanged.
	
	If kOpDestWaveOverwriteExistingWave is set, if the destination wave already exists
	it is overwritten using the specified dimension sizes and data type. The overwritten
	wave's properties (units, dimension scaling, dimension labels, wave note) are set
	to default values. Its data is left as is and you should treat it as uninitialized.
	
	The choice between kOpDestWaveChangeExistingWave and kOpDestWaveOverwriteExistingWave
	must be made on a case-by-case basis. If you are converting an existing operation to
	use GetOperationDestWave you should choose between kOpDestWaveChangeExistingWave
	and kOpDestWaveOverwriteExistingWave so that the behavior of your operation will not change.
	For most new applications, kOpDestWaveOverwriteExistingWave is preferrable since it makes
	the output of the operation independent of pre-existing conditions.
	
	If kOpDestWaveChangeExistingWave and kOpDestWaveOverwriteExistingWave are both cleared,
	then GetOperationDestWave will not change the dimensions and data type of a pre-existing
	destination wave. In this case, it is up to you to make sure that the dimensions and data
	type of the returned wave are appropriate and change them if necessary.

	If kOpDestWaveChangeExistingWave and kOpDestWaveOverwriteExistingWave are both set,
	this is a programmer error and an error is returned.
	
	If your operation has a /FREE flag, signifying that the destination wave should be
	a free wave, set the kOpDestWaveMakeFreeWave bit. If kOpDestWaveMakeFreeWave is set,
	GetOperationDestWave makes a new free wave as the destination wave and returns it
	via destWaveHPtr and all other option flag are ignored. This requires Igor Pro
	6.20 or later.
	
	If kOpDestWaveMakeFreeWave is not set, this procedure is followed: If the
	destination wave was specified via a wave reference by the calling user-defined
	function, GetOperationDestWave returns that wave via destWaveHPtr. Otherwise it
	looks for an existing wave specified by dfH and name. If there is an existing wave,
	GetOperationDestWave reuses it. Otherwise it creates a new wave using dfH and name.
	The rules for obtaining the destination wave via a wave reference are explained
	in the documentation for GetOperationWaveRef.
	
	If kOpDestWaveMustAlreadyExist is set, then, if the destination wave does not
	already exist, the NOWAV ("expected wave name") error is returned. You may want to
	test for NOWAV and return a more specific error code. If you set kOpDestWaveMustAlreadyExist
	you must also set kOpDestWaveOverwriteOK because if kOpDestWaveOverwriteOK is
	cleared GetOperationDestWave returns an error if the destination wave exists.
	
	If you want to return an existing wave only without overwriting or changing it,
	pass (kOpDestWaveMustAlreadyExist | kOpDestWaveOverwriteOK) and leave all other
	bits cleared.
	
	dimensionSizes is an array of wave dimension sizes as shown in the example below.
	If kOpDestWaveMustAlreadyExist is set and kOpDestWaveChangeExistingWave,
	kOpDestWaveOverwriteExistingWave and kOpDestWaveMakeFreeWave are cleared then
	dimensionSizes is not used and you can pass NULL.
	
	dataType is normally a standard Igor data type (e.g., NT_FP64, (NT_FP32 | NT_CMPLX),
	TEXT_WAVE_TYPE). However, if you pass NULL for dimensionSizes, you must pass -1 for
	dataType, indicating that you do not want to change the data type.
	
	If destWaveCreatedPtr is not NULL, *destWaveCreatedPtr is set to 1 if GetOperationDestWave
	created a new wave or to 0 if GetOperationDestWave reused an existing wave.
	
	In the following example, the operation is defined by this Operation Handler syntax:
		SampleOp /DEST=DataFolderAndName:{dest,real}
	This results in an operation runtime parameter structure containing:
		int DESTFlagEncountered;
		DataFolderAndName dest;
		int DESTFlagParamsSet[1];
	
	Here is typical usage for an operation with a /DEST flag. In this example, p is a pointer
	to the operation runtime parameter structure:
	
		waveHndl destWaveH;						// Destination wave handle.
		int destWaveRefIdentifier;				// Used to access the destination wave if specified using a wave reference
		char destWaveName[MAX_OBJ_NAME+1];
		DataFolderHandle dfH;
		int dataType;
		CountInt dimensionSizes[MAX_DIMENSIONS+1];
		int destWaveCreated;
		int options;
		int err;
		
		destWaveH = NULL;
		destWaveRefIdentifier = 0;

		strcpy(destWaveName, "W_SampleOp");			// Default dest wave name
		dfH = NULL;									// Default is current data folder
		
		dataType = NT_FP64;
		MemClear(dimensionSizes, sizeof(dimensionSizes));
		dimensionSizes[ROWS] = 100;
		
		if (p->DESTFlagEncountered) {
			strcpy(destWaveName, p->dest.name);
			dfH = p->dest.dfH;
			// If a wave reference was used, p->destParamsSet[0] contains information that
			// GetOperationDestWave uses to find the address of the wave reference.
			destWaveRefIdentifier = p->DESTFlagParamsSet[0];
		}
		
		options = kOpDestWaveOverwriteOK | kOpDestWaveOverwriteExistingWave;
		
		err = GetOperationDestWave(tp, dfH, destWaveName, destWaveRefIdentifier, options, dimensionSizes, dataType, &destWaveH, &destWaveCreated);
		if (err != 0)
			return err;
		
		<Store output data in dest wave>
		
		// Set wave reference to refer to destination wave.
		if (destWaveRefIdentifier != 0)
			SetOperationWaveRef(tp, destWaveH, destWaveRefIdentifier);

	The call to SetOperationWaveRef sets the automatic destination wave reference created
	by Operation Handler when you use the DataFolderAndName syntax shown above in your
	operation template.

	GetOperationDestWave was added for Igor Pro 6.20. If you call this with an earlier
	version of Igor, it will still return a destination wave but without recognizing
	any wave referenced passed via the /DEST flag. For example:
		Wave w = root:wave0
		SampleOp /O /DEST=w
	In Igor Pro 6.20 and later, this overwrites a wave named wave0 in the root
	data folder. However, prior to Igor Pro 6.20, it creates a wave named w
	in the current data folder. This is how destination waves worked in XOPs
	prior to Igor Pro 6.20.
	
	If kOpDestWaveMakeFreeWave is set in the options parameter and you are running
	with a version of Igor prior to 6.20, GetOperationDestWave returns IGOR_OBSOLETE.
	
	Thread Safety: GetOperationDestWave is Igor-thread-safe with XOP Toolkit 6 and Igor Pro 6.20 or later.
	You can call it from a thread created by Igor but not from a private thread that you created yourself.

/*	SetOperationWaveRef(waveH, waveRefIndentifier)

	Sets a wave reference in an Igor user-defined function to refer to a destination wave
	that your operation created.

	This is used only to implement an operation using Igor's Operation Handler.
	It must be called only from your ExecuteOperation function.
	
	This function is used only for operations which use a DataFolderAndName parameter
	and declare it as a destination wave parameter using this kind of syntax in the
	operation template:
	
		SampleOp DataFolderAndName:{dest,<real> or <complex> or <text>}
		
	When you use this syntax and your operation is compiled in a user-defined function,
	the Igor function compiler may automatically create a wave reference in the function
	for the destination wave. However the automatically created wave reference will be
	NULL until you set it by calling SetOperationWaveRef.
	
	The SetOperationWaveRef callback sets the automatically created wave reference to
	refer to a specific wave, namely the wave that you created in response to the
	DataFolderAndName parameter. You must call it after successfully creating the
	destination wave.
	
	Igor will create an automatic wave reference only if the operation is called
	from a user-defined function and only if the destination wave is specified using
	a simple name (e.g., wave0 but not root:wave0 or $destWave). You have no way to know
	whether an automatic wave reference was created so you must call SetOperationWaveRef
	in all cases. SetOperationWaveRef will do nothing if no automatic wave reference
	exists.	
	
	The waveRefIndentifier parameter allows Igor to determine where in memory the wave
	reference is stored. This information is passed to your XOP in the "ParamSet" field
	of your ExecuteOperation structure.
	
	Your code should look something like this:
	
		// In your RuntimeParams structure
		DataFolderAndName dest;
		int destParamsSet[1];
	
		// In your ExecuteOperation function
		destWaveH = NULL;
		err = MDMakeWave(&destWaveH, p->dest.name, p->dest.dfH, dimensionSizes, type, overwrite);

/*	ThreadGroupPutDF(threadGroupID, dataFolderH)

	ThreadGroupPutDF is used to pass data folders between Igor threads by way of
	an Igor-maintained queue. It snips the specified data folder from the data
	hierarchy of the calling thread and posts it to a queue from which it can be
	retrieved by calling ThreadGroupGetDF from a different thread.
	
	When called from the main thread, ThreadGroupPutDF removes the specified data folder
	from the main thread's data hierarchy and posts it to the input queue of the Igor
	thread group specified by threadGroupID. You would do this to pass a data folder
	to an Igor preemptive thread for processing.
	
	When called from an Igor preemptive thread, ThreadGroupPutDF removes the specified
	data folder from the running thread's data hierarchy and posts it to the output queue
	of the thread group. You would do this to pass data from an Igor preemptive thread
	to the main thread. In this case, threadGroupID is ignored and you can pass 0 for it.

	threadGroupID is a thread group ID passed to you from a calling user-defined function
	or 0 as described above. See the Igor documentation for ThreadGroupCreate for further
	discussion of thread group IDs.
	
	dataFolderH is a handle to the data folder to be removed from the currently-running
	Igor thread's data hierarchy and transferred to the thread group's input queue or
	output queue as described above.
	
	dataFolderH must be a valid data folder handle. It must not be NULL.
	
	If ThreadGroupPutDF succeeds, the specified data folder handle is no longer valid
	and must not be further used.
	
	See the Igor documentation for the ThreadGroupPutDF operation for further details
	and warnings.

	Added for Igor Pro 6.23. If you call this with an earlier version of Igor,

/*	ThreadGroupGetDF(threadGroupID, waitMilliseconds, dataFolderHPtr)

	ThreadGroupGetDF is used to pass data folders between Igor threads by way of
	an Igor-maintained queue. It removes a data folder from the queue, if one is available,
	and stitches it into the data hierarchy of the currently running Igor thread.
	
	When called from the main thread, ThreadGroupGetDF returns a data folder from the
	output queue of the thread group specified by threadGroupID or NULL if there are
	no data folders in the queue. If a data folder is available, it is stitched into
	the main thread's data hierarchy. You would do this to move results from an
	Igor preemptive thread into the main thread for display and further processing.

	When called from an Igor preemptive thread, ThreadGroupGetDF returns a data folder
	from the input queue of the currently running Igor thread's thread group or NULL
	if there are no data folders in the queue. You would do this to get input from the
	main thread into the Igor premptive thread. If a data folder is available, it is
	stitched into the currently-running Igor thread's data hierarchy. In this case,
	threadGroupID is ignored and you can pass 0 for it.

	threadGroupID is a thread group ID passed to you from a calling user-defined function
	or 0 as described above. See the Igor documentation for ThreadGroupCreate for further
	discussion of thread group IDs.
	
	waitMilliseconds is the number of milliseconds to wait to see if a data folder becomes
	available in the queue. Pass 0 to test if a data folder is available immediately.
	The value for waitMilliseconds must be between 0 and 2147483647 (2^31-1 milliseconds
	- about 25 days).
	
	*dataFolderHPtr is set to NULL if no data folders are available or to a handle to
	the data folder that was retrieved from the queue. Igor changes the name of the
	data folder if that is necessary to make it unique within its parent data folder.
	
	On return, check the function result from ThreadGroupGetDF and *dataFolderHPtr.
	If the function result is 0 and *dataFolderHPtr is not NULL then *dataFolderHPtr
	is a valid data folder handle in the currently-running thread's data hierarchy.
