/*
**	The data structures here are the same as those used internally by
**	Igor Pro.  Unlike wave handles you deal with these structures directly.
**	Thus you have to be careful to verify version numbers
**	before using.
**	NOTE:
**		as of 8-17-94, this structure def was changed to be ansii compliant.
**		Previously, the fifoData item at the end of the struct was a [0]
**		and is now a [1]. We still think of it as [0] and use the follow
**		to determine the base size:
**			ZSIZEOF(NamedFIFO,fifoData)
**		where ZSIZEOF is defined like so:
**			#define ZSIZEOF(x,y) ((size_t)&( (x *) 0)->y)
**
**	LH951230: Made sneaky change to struct ChartChanInfo. First element
**		was a long and is now two shorts. Old code should contine to work
**		without change.
**
**	JW980205: Made another sneaky change. In NamedFIFO structure, shortened
**		the fifoVersion field to unsigned char in order to use the high byte
**		for bitwise flags. So far, only one bit is used: bit 0 on means that
**		bytes must be swapped when reading the FIFO's file. An XOP that gets
**		this new version won't be affected as long as it either only writes
**		to FIFO files, or if it only works with FIFO's written on the same platform.
**		An XOP that really needs to handle cross-platform FIFO's must be re-written
**		to use the new field.
