Igor XOP Resource Templates For Macintosh XOPsThe resource fork of this file contains resource template resources(TMPL) for the unique resources used by XOPs. The resource templatesmake creating and editing these resources in ResEdit easier.To use the resource templates you must first install them in theResEdit Prefs file which is normally in your system folder.Once they're installed, you can used them to create or editthe following resources in your XOP's resource fork:	XOPI, XOPC, XOPF, XMN1, XSM1 and XMI1.These templates were created and tested using ResEdit 2.0B2.*** Installing the templates ***To install the templates, first run ResEdit.Next, open the resource fork of this file (XOP Resource Templates).Click on the TMPL resources and copy them to the clipboard.Close the resource fork of this file.Now, open the resource fork of the ResEdit Preferences file.Do a paste.Close and save the ResEdit Preferences file.*** Using the templates ***To use the templates, open the resource fork of the XOP whoseXOP resources you want to edit.Find the XOP resource and open it.ResEdit will use the templates to present the resources in asemi-intelligent fashion.Refer to the XOP manual for exactly what must be in the resources.If you want to add a command to the new record to any XOP resource,click on the last ***** (bunch of asterisks) in the ResEdit window.Then select 'Create New Resource' from the 'Resource' menu.NOTE:	For reasons that we don't understand, adding commands to the	XOPC resource does not work unless you select the FIRST	***** (bunch of asterisks), not the last.
