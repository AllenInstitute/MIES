AnalysisBrowser
===============

The AnalysisBrowser allows browsing and loading acquired data from Igor Experiment files
(pxp and uxp) and NeuroDataWithoutBorders files (NWB, v1 and v2) into one Igor
Experiment. The user can also combine sweeps from multiple experiments in one
SweepBrowser, see :ref:`DataBrowser`, inspect the labnotebook entries of these
sweeps and view the :ref:`TPStorage` data.
