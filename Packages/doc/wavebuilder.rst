WaveBuilder
============

The WaveBuilder is used to create a series of related sweeps called a stimulus
set. A sweep is composed of up to 99 epochs. Each epoch can contain one of
seven different waveform types, arbitrary combinations of waveform types, or a
custom waveform. A custom waveform can be a sweep from a different stimulus
set, or a waveform generated by the user using other tools. Custom code to
automate analysis or data acquisition may be linked with a stimulus set using
the WaveBuilder.
