Working with dot files
======================

Editing dot files works best with the dotty tool. See
[here](https://graphviz.org/pdf/dottyguide.pdf) for the manual.
After you have edited the dot files, be sure to run the script `tools/cleanup-dotfiles.sh`.

For printing convert to PDF, `Export as...` in Inkscape, and then poster printer (2x or 4x) on A3 paper.
