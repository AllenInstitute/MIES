MIES is a sweep based data acquisition tool written in Igor Pro.

MIES has three primary user interfaces: The :ref:`wavebuilder`, :ref:`daephys`, and
:ref:`databrowser`. The WaveBuilder is used to generate stimulus sets. The DA_Ephys
GUI is used to control and observe data acquisition in real time. The
DataBrowser is used to browse acquired data. All three interfaces are intended
to be operated in parallel.
