- Properly select NONE with multiple devices with data

DataBrowser/SweepBrowser
------------------------

- Fix loading and displaying of old experiments

Labnotebook
-----------

New numerical keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Set correct electrode number for associated DA/AD:
  Bug introduced in 7c37bf08 (NWB: Use Labnotebook property electrodeName
  if available, 2016-08-06).

  With default electrode names, which are just strings with the electrode
  numbers, the buggy source attributes are

  ITC1600_Dev_0;Sweep=0;AD=10;ElectrodeNumber=0;ElectrodeName=6

  (note the difference between the ElectrodeName and the ElectrodeNumber)

  where as it should be

  ITC1600_Dev_0;Sweep=0;AD=10;ElectrodeNumber=6;ElectrodeName=6

  written by NWB_GetTimeSeriesProperties are fetched for the first
  headstage and not for the correct ones.

  segment wave note.

- Use differnt colors for sweeps in the wavebuilder
- Show the delta mode also for the custom wave
- Show user analysis functions from UserAnalysisFunctions.ipf as well in the popup menues

  waves. Recreate the stimsets if one of the following elements changed:

  - any custom wave has changed

  We now document the settings of each sweep (aka step) and not only of the first
  including delta. This also changes the format of the sweep wave note.

  Example of the new stimset wave note format:

  .. code-block:: text

    Sweep = 0;Epoch = 0;Type = Square pulse;Duration = 1000;Amplitude = 0;
    Sweep = 0;Epoch = 1;Type = Pulse Train;Duration = 1840.01;Amplitude = 1;Offset = 0;Pulse Type = Square;Frequency = 5;Pulse duration = 40;Number of pulses = 10;Poisson distribution = False;Random seed = 0.943029;Definition mode = Duration;

   - Fast creation, at least a magnitude faster, by using IFFT and FilterIIR
   - Unified approach for white, pink and brown noise
   - Fix interchanged definitions for pink and brown noise
   - Only one filter coefficient, ranging from 1 to 100, with delta remains
   - ``1/f increment`` was replaced by the experimental build resolution option

     Mersenne-Twister as pseudo random number generator
   - epoch noise tab cleanup

   Keeping the old method for compatibility with existing parameter stimset waves was deemed
   not worth the effort.
