.. _SweepFormula:

The Sweep Formula Module
------------------------

The Sweep Formula Module in `MIES_Sweepformula.ipf` is intended to be used from
the SF tab in the BrowserSettingsPanel (BSP). It is useful for analyzing a
range of sweeps using pre-defined functions. The backend parses a formula into
a `JSON logic <http://jsonlogic.com/>`_ like pattern which in turn is analyzed
to return a wave for plotting.

Preprocessing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The entered code in the notebook is preprocessed. The preprocessor
removes comments before testing the code for the ` vs ` operator after which
it is passed to the formula parser.
Comments start with a `#` character and end at the end of the current line.

Formula Parser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for a formula to get executed, it has to be analyzed. This assures
that the correct order of calculations is used. The approach for solving this
is using a token based state machine. We virtually insert one character at a
time from left to right into the state machine. Usually, a character is
collected into a buffer. At some special characters like a `+` sign, the state
changes from collect to addition. If a state changes, a new evaluation group is
created which is represented with a JSON object who's (single) member is the
operation. The member name is the operation and the value is an ordered array
of the operands. To ensure that multiplication is executed before addition to
get `1+2*3=7` and not `1+2*3=9` the states have a priority. Higher order states
cause the operation order to switch. The old operation becomes part of the new
operation. In this context, when the first array or function argument separator `,`
is parsed on a level, it is treated as higher order operations because it creates
a new array.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "+": [
       1,
       {
         "*": [
           2,
           3
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

Arrays start with a square bracket `[` and end with a `]`. Subsequent array elements are
separated by a `,`. In a series of arrays like `[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]` the `,` after
the `]` is enforced by the parser. Arrays can be part of arrays. Since at its core very
formula input is an array the series of arrays `[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]` is implicitly
a 2-dimensional array: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`. The same applies for simple inputs like
`1`, which is implicitly treated as 1-dimensional array: `[1]`. The input `[[1]]` instead
is treated as 1x1 2-dimensional array.
Arrays are special as
also function arguments contain array elements. Therefore, an array can also
simply be created by omitting the array brackets and only using element
separators similar as in functions. The function `max(1,2)` is therefore
treated the same as `max([1,2])`. Arrays can represent data and functions
evaluate to arrays. Arrays can be of arbitrary size and can also be
concatenated as in `max(0,min(1,2),1)`.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "max": [
       0,
       {
         "min": [
           1,
           2
         ]
       },
       1
     ]
   }

A number can be entered as `1000`, `1e3`, or `10.0e2`. It is always stored as a
numeric value and not as string. The formula parser treats everything that is
not parsable but matches alphanumeric characters (excluding operations) to a
string as in `a_string`. White spaces are ignored throughout the
formula which means that strings do *not* need to get enclosed by `"`. In fact,
a `"` is an disallowed character.

.. code-block:: json

   [
     1000,
     "a_string"
   ]

A function is defined as a string that is directly followed by an opening
parenthesis. The parenthesis token causes to force a collect state until all
parentheses are closed.

Everything that is collected in a buffer is sent back to the function via
recursive execution. The formula parser only handles elements inside one
recursion call that are linearly combinable like `1*2+3*4`. If same operations
follow each other, they are concatenated into the same array level as for
`1+2+3+4`.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "+": [
       1,
       2,
       3,
       4
     ]
   }

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "+": [
       {
         "*": [
           1,
           2
         ]
       },
       {
         "*": [
           3,
           4
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

The formula is sent to a preparser that checks for the correct
amount of brackets and converts multi-character operations to their multi-character
UTF-8 representations like `...` to `â€¦`. It should be noted that an
operation consists of one UTF-8 character. Functions on the other hand can
consist of an arbitrary length of alphanumeric characters. The corresponding
function for the above operation is `range()`.

Formula Executor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The formula executor receives a JSON id. It can only evaluate a specific
structure of a formula which means for usual cases that it should start with an
object that contains *one* operation. Operations are evaluated via recursive
calls to the formula executor at different paths. This ensures that the formula
is evaluated from the last element to the first element. The formula in the
above example `1*2+3*4` is therefore parsed to

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "+": [
       {
         "*": [
           1,
           2
         ]
       },
       {
         "*": [
           3,
           4
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

The execution follows these steps:

1. evaluate `/` to `+` operation, call `+`
2. called from `+` operation -> evaluate `/+` array to array with two elements
3. evaluate `/+/0` to `*` operation with an array argument with two elements 1, 2
4. called from `*` operation -> evaluate `/+/0/*` array to wave {1, 2}
5. `*` operation is applied to wave {1, 2}, returning wave {2}
6. insert wave {2} as first element of array from step 2
7. evaluate `/+/1` to * operation with an array argument with two elements 3, 4
8. called from `*` operation -> evaluate `/+/0/*` array to wave {3, 4}
9. `*` operation is applied to wave {3, 4}, returning wave {12}
10. insert wave {12} as second element of array from step 2
11. `+` operation is applied to wave {2, 12} returning wave {14}

At the time of an evaluation, the maximum depth of an array is
four dimensions as Igor Pro supports only four dimensions. This implies that on
recursive evaluation of multi dimensional arrays the sub arrays can be
three dimensional at best.

Array Evaluation
""""""""""""""""

The array evaluation supports numeric and text data. The interpretation of the JSON arrays as
text data is preferred. This means that `["NaN"]` returns a one element text wave `{"NaN"}`,
whereas `[1, "NaN"]` returns a two element numeric wave `{1, NaN}`. If one element can not be
parsed as string then it is assumed that the array contains numeric data.
The JSON null element is only allowed for the topmost array as the parser inserts it for
operation with no argument like e.g. `select()`. For sub arrays null elements `[null]`
are invalid and result in an error.

If the topmost array is empty `[]` an empty numeric wave with zero size is returned.
When checked in operation code the wave size should be checked before the wave type.

If the current array evaluated is of size one, then
the wave note is transferred from the subArray to the current array. This is important for the case where the element of
the current array is an JSON object, thus an operation, and the operation result is a single value with meta data in the wave.

Formula Executor Limitations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Mixed data types in arrays are not supported as this JSON property is hard to translate to Igor Pro data
storage in waves.

Internal Data Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data is stored internally in persistant wave reference waves in a data folder, e.g.
`root:MIES:HardwareDevices:Dev1:Databrowser:FormulaData:`. The reason is that operation like `data(...)`
should be able to return multiple independent sweep data waves. These can be returned through a
wave reference wave. Each wave referenced contains numeric or text data.
The formula executor works on the JSON data that was created by the formula parser only.
This data is by definition either an object (operation), numeric or a textual.
If an operation like `data(...)` returns sweep data of multiple sweeps in a persistent wave reference wave
for the formula executor a single element text wave is created.
This text wave encodes a marker and the path to the wave reference wave in the first element.
The wave reference wave is resolved by wrapper functions when calling the formula executor,
such that the formula executor works only with the data wave(s).

Wrapper functions are:

- `SF_GetArgument`: retrieves an operation argument, returns a wave reference wave. If in the JSON from the parser the argument consists of 'direct' data like an array then it is automatically converted to a wave reference wave with one element that refers to the data wave.
- `SF_GetArgumentSingle`: retrieves an operation argument expecting only a single data wave. Returns the data wave.
- `SF_GetArgumentTop`: retrieves all operation arguments as an array, returns a wave reference wave.
- `SF_GetOutputForExecutor`: Takes a wave reference wave as input and creates a single element text wave for returning further to the formula executor.
- `SF_GetOutputForExecutorSingle`: Takes a data wave as input, creates a single element wave reference wave referring to the data wave and creates text wave for returning further to the formula executor.

The wrapper function imply that the formula executor is never called directly from operation code.
Also directly parsing the JSON is not allowed in operation code because every argument could be another operation or multi dimensional array etc.

Debugging Formula Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default only the currently used wave reference waves are persistent. For debugging the execution the `SWEEPFORMULA_DEBUG` define can be set:
`#define SWEEPFORMULA_DEBUG`.
When set all data waves and wave reference waves are stored persistently in the sweepformula working data folder that are created during the execution.
The naming scheme is as follows: "source_pointOfCreation" with

source
  typically the name of the operation or "ExecutorSubArrayEvaluation"

pointOfCreation:

output
  wave reference wave output of operation

dataInput
  data wave of direct data from JSON

refFromuserInput
  wave reference wave automatically created to for data wave of direct data from JSON

return_argX\_
  data wave(s) returned by an operation, X counts the data waves aka index in the associated wave reference wave

argTop
  prefix for the upper tags, added when data was parsed from the top level, used e.g. by `integrate(1, 2)`

The final wave name might be suffixed by a number guaranteeing unique wave names when multiple times the same operation was called.

Operations
^^^^^^^^^^

In the context of the formula executor, different operations and functions are
defined. Some of them are *MIES* specific, some of them are wrappers to Igor
Pro operations or functions, some borrowed from other languages and there are
also the simple, trivial operations. This section should give a list of the
available operations and give a look into how they are meant to be used

The trivial operations are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. They are defined for all
available dimensions and evaluate column based.

They can be used for evaluating

1. scalars with 1d waves as in `1 + [1, 2] = [1, 1] + [1, 2] = [2, 3]`
2. 1d waves with 1d waves as in `[1, 2] + [3, 4] = [4, 6]`
3. 1d waves with 2d waves as in `[1, 2] + [[3, 4], [5, 6]] = [[1 + 3, 2 + 5], [NaN + 4, NaN + 6]] = [[4, 7], [NaN, NaN]]`
4. 2d waves with 2d waves as in `[[1, 2], [3, 4]] + [[5, 6], [7, 8]] = [[6, 8], [10, 12]]`

The size in each dimension is expanded to match the maximum array size. The maximum array size is determined by the required maximum dimensions of the elements in the topmost array.
An array element can be a number, a string, an array or an operation. A number or string a scalar. An sub array or operaton result is scalar if it returns a single element.
The expansion is filled with for numeric waves with `NaN` or for textual waves with `""`.
In the special case of a scalar element, the value is expanded to the full size and dimensions of the expanded arrays size.
This means that in our first example, 1 is scalar and is internally expanded to an array of size 2 because the second operand determines the maximum size of 2:
`1 + [1, 2] == [1, 1] + [1, 2]`.
On the other hand in the third example above the first arrays size is expanded but not its value as it is not a scalar.
The array size expansion and scalar elements expansion is applied recursively for more dimensions.
Note that operations in array elements may return multi dimensional sub arrays that lead to an overall array expansion that is greater as the formula input suggests.

This can be used to force, for example, a category plot.
`text` requires numeric input data. The output data has the same dimension as the input data. The output precision for the text are 7 digits after the dot.
The operation accepts multiple data waves for the data argument.
For this case the operation is applied on each input data wave independently and returns the same number of data waves.

.. code-block:: bash

   range(5) vs text(range(5))

data
""""

The `data` operation is the core of the `SweepFormula` library. It returns sweep data from *MIES*.
It can be called in two variants:

.. code-block:: bash

   data(array range[, array selectData])

   data(string epochShortName[, array selectData])

The range can be either supplied explicitly using `[100, 300]` which would
select `100 ms` to `300 ms` or by using `cursors` that also returns a range specification. In case `cursors()` is
used but there are no cursors on the graph, the full x-range is used. A numerical range applies to all sweeps.

Instead of a numerical range also the short name of an epoch can be given. Then the range
is determined from the epoch information of each sweep/channel data iterates over. If a specified epoch does not exist in a sweep
that sweep data is not included in the sweep data returned.

selectData is retrieved through the `select` operation. It selects for which sweeps and channels sweep data is returned.
`select` also allows to choose currently displayed sweeps or all existing sweeps as data source.
When the optional selectData argument is omitted, `select()` is used as default that includes all displayed sweeps and channels.

For each selected sweep/channel combination data returns a data wave. The data wave contains the sweep data for the specified range/epoch.
If no sweep/channel was selected then the number of returned data waves is zero. Each data wave gets meta data about the originating sweep/channel added.
The returned data type is `SF_DATATYPE_SWEEP`.

.. code-block:: bash

   // Shows the AD channels of all displayed sweeps with the range 0 - 1s
   data([0, 1000], select(channels(AD), sweeps()))

   // Shows epoch "E1" range of the AD channels of all displayed sweeps
   data("E1", select(channels(AD), sweeps()))

labnotebook
"""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

   labnotebook(string key[, array selectData [, string entrySourceType]])

The labnotebook function returns the (case insensitive) `key` entry from the
labnotebook for the selected channel and sweep combination(s). The optional
`entrySourceType` can be one of the constants `DataAcqModes` for data
acquisition modes as defined in `../MIES/MIES_Constants.ipf`. If the
`entrySourceType` is omitted it defaults to `DATA_ACQUISITION_MODE`.

When the optional select argument is omitted, `select()` is used as default that includes all displayed sweeps and channels.

The `labnotebook` operation returns a data wave for each selected sweep/channel combination. Each data wave contains a single element, that is depending on the
requested labnotebook entry numeric or textual.

The returned data type is `SF_DATATYPE_LABNOTEBOOK`.
If input data type is `SF_DATATYPE_SWEEP` from the data operation the sweep meta data is transferred to the returned data waves.
The default suggested x-axis values for the formula plotter are sweep numbers.
The suggested y-axis label is the labnotebook key.

.. code-block:: bash

   max(
      data(
         cursors(AB)
         channels(AD),
         sweeps()
      )
   )
   vs
   labnotebook(
      "set cycle count",
      select(channels(AD), sweeps()),
      DATA_ACQUISITION_MODE
   )

The function searches for numeric entries in the labnotebook first and then for
text entries. It returns a null wave if no match was found.

findlevel
"""""""""

The operation `findlevel` returns the x-position of the first transition to the given level.

.. code-block:: bash

   findlevel(array data, variable level[, variable edge])

data
  one or multiple data waves. If multiple data waves are given then the same number of data waves is returned. The operation is applied for each data wave separately.

level
  level value to find

edge
  defines which transition is to be found. Valid values are  rising and falling `0`, rising `1` or falling `2`. The default for edge is rising and falling `0`.

The returned data type is `SF_DATATYPE_FINDLEVEL`.
If input data type is `SF_DATATYPE_SWEEP` from the data operation the sweep meta data is transferred to the returned data waves.

.. code-block:: bash

   findlevel([1, 2, 3], 1.5) == [0.5]

apfrequency
"""""""""""

The `apfrequency` operation returns the action potential frequency using the given method.

.. code-block:: bash

   apfrequency(array data[, variable method[, variable level]])

data
  one or multiple data waves. If multiple data waves are given then the same number of data waves is returned. The operation is applied for each data wave separately.

method
  the method can be either `0` for "full", `1` for "instantaneous" or `2` for apcount. The default method is `0`.

level
  level value. The default level is 0.

The calculation for these methods are done using the below formulas where
:math:`l` denotes the number of found levels, :math:`t_{i}` the timepoint in
seconds of the level and :math:`T` the total x range of the data in seconds.

.. math::
   f_{\text{full}}          &= \frac{l}{T}                                                         \\
   f_{\text{instantaneous}} &= \frac{1}{\sum_{i = 0}^{i = l - 1} \left( t_{i + 1} - t_{i} \right)} \\
   f_{\text{apcount}}       &= l                                                                   \\

The returned data type is `SF_DATATYPE_APFREQUENCY`.
If input data type is `SF_DATATYPE_SWEEP` from the data operation the sweep meta data is transferred to the returned data waves.

.. code-block:: bash

   apfrequency([10, 20, 30], 1, 15)

powerspectrum
"""""""""""""

The `powerspectrum` operation returns the power spectrum of the input data

.. code-block:: bash

   powerspectrum(array data[, string unit[, string average[, variable ratioFrequency[, variable cutOffFrequency[, string windowFunction]]]]])

data
  one or multiple data waves.

unit
  the unit can be either `default`, `dB` for decibel or `normalized` for the spectrum normalized by its total energy. The default method is `default`.
  `default` means e.g. if the signal unit is `V` then the y-axis unit of the power spectrum is `V^2`.

average
  this argument allows to enable averaging over all sweeps of the same channel/channeltype combination. Possible values are `avg` and `noavg`.
  The default average setting is `noavg`. If data waves do not originate from a sweep, then it is averaged over all of these data waves.
  e.g. if there are two data waves from sweep 0,1 AD1, two data waves from sweep 0,1 AD2 and two data waves not from a sweep then
  there will be three averaged waves: over all sweeps for channel combination AD1, over all sweeps for channel combination AD2 and over all data waves not from a sweep.

ratioFrequency
  this argument allows to specify a frequency where the ratio between base line and signal is determined through a gaussian fit with a linear base.
  A typical use is to look for line noise at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. If a non zero ratioFrequency is set then the result is a single data point per power spectrum wave.
  The returned ratio is `(amplitude + baseline_level) / baseline_level`. The default ratioFrequency is `0`, that disables the ratio determination.

cutOffFrequency
  The cutOffFrequency allows to limit the maximum displayed frequency of the powerspectrum. The default cutOffFrequncy is `1000` Hz.
  The maximum cutOffFrequency is half of the sample frequency. This argument is ignored if a ratioFrequency > 0 is set.

windowFunction
  allows to specify the window function applied for the FFT. The default windowFunction is `Hanning`.
  Possible options are `none` to disable the application of a window function and the window functions known to Igor Pro 9. See `DisplayHelpTopic "FFT"`.

The gaussian fit for the power ratio calculation uses the following constraints:

- The peak position must be between ratioFrequency Â± 0.25 Hz
- The maximum FWHM are 5 Hz
- The amplitude must be >= 0
- The base of the peak must be > 0

If the fit fails a ratio of 0 is returned.

The returned data type is `SF_DATATYPE_POWERSPECTRUM`.
If input data type is `SF_DATATYPE_SWEEP` from the data operation and non-averaged power spectrum is calculated the sweep meta data is transferred to the returned data waves.

.. code-block:: bash

   powerspectrum(data(cursors(A,B),select(channels(AD),sweeps(),all)))

   powerspectrum(data(cursors(A,B),select(channels(AD),sweeps(),all)),dB,avg,0,100,HFT248D) // db units, averaging on, display up to 100 Hz, use HFT248D window

   powerspectrum(data(cursors(A,B),select(channels(AD),sweeps(),all)),dB,avg,60) // db units, averaging on, determine power ratio at 60 Hz

Utility Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

select
""""""

The `select` operation allows to choose a selection of sweep data from a given list of sweeps and channels.
It is intended to be used with operations like `data`, `labnotebook`, `epochs` and `tp`.

.. code-block:: bash

   select([array channels, array sweeps[, string mode[, string clampMode]]])

The function accepts none, two, three or four arguments.

channels
  array with channel specification from `channels` operation. When channels is not specified, it defaults to `channels()`.

sweeps
  array with sweep number, typically from `sweeps` operation. When sweeps is not specified, it defaults to `sweeps()`.

mode
  string specifying which sweeps are selected. Possible strings are `displayed` and `all` that refer to the currently displayed sweeps or all acquired sweeps. When mode is not specified it defaults to `displayed`.

clampMode
  string specifying which clamp mode is selected. Possible strings are `all`, `vc`, `ic` and  `izero`. When clampMode is not specified it defaults to `all`.

To retrieve a correct array of channels the `channels` function must be used.

If a given channel/sweep combination does not exist it is omitted in the output.

The output is a N x 3 array where the columns are sweep number, channel type, channel number.

The output is sorted. The order is sweep -> channel type -> channel number.
e.g. for two sweeps numbered 0, 1 that have channels AD0, AD1, DA6, DA7:
`{{0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1}, {0, 1, 6, 7, 0, 1, 6, 7}}`.

If the mode is `displayed` and no traces are displayed then a null wave is returned.
If sweeps or channels is a null wave then select returns a null wave.
If there are no matching sweeps found a null wave is returned.

.. code-block:: bash

   select()
   select(channels(AD), sweeps(), all)
   select(channels(AD4, DA), [1, 5]], all)
   select(channels(AD2, DA5, AD0, DA6), [0, 1, 3, 7], all)
   select(channels(AD2, DA5, AD0, DA6), [0, 1, 3, 7], all, ic)

range
"""""

The range function is borrowed from `python
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range>`_. It expands
values into a new array.

This function can also be used as an operation with the "â€¦" operator which is
the Unicode Character 'HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS' (U+2026). Writing "..." is automatically converted to "â€¦".

.. code-block:: bash

   range(variable start[, variable stop[, variable step]])

   start...stop

   startâ€¦stop

The function generally accepts 1 to 3 arguments. The operation is intended to be
used with two arguments.

The operation accepts also multiple data waves as first argument. Each data wave content must follow the operation argument order and size in that case.
For this case the operation is applied on each input data wave independently and returns the same number of data waves.
The returned data type is `SF_DATATYPE_RANGE`.

.. code-block:: bash

   range(1, 5, 0.7) == [1, 1.7, 2.4, 3.1, 3.8, 4.5]

epochs
""""""

The epochs operation returns information from epochs.

.. code-block:: bash

   epochs(string name[, array selectData[, string type]])

name
  the name of the epoch.

selectData
  the second argument is a selection of sweeps and channels where the epoch information is retrieved from. It must be specified through the `select` operation. When the optional second argument is omitted, `select()` is used as default that includes all displayed sweeps and channels.

type
  sets what information is returned. Valid types are: `range`, `name` or `treelevel`. If type is not specified then `range` is used as default.

The operation returns for each selected sweep a data wave. The sweep meta data is transferred to the output data waves.
If there was nothing selected the number of returned data waves is zero.
If the selection contains channels that do not have epoch information stored, e.g. `AD`, these selections are skipped in the evaluation.
For example if `select()` is used for the selectData argument then all channels are selected, but only for `DA` channels epoch information is stored in the labnotebook.
Thus, there are data waves only returned for the `DA` channels.
If a selection has epoch information stored in the labnotebook and the specified epoch does not exist it is skipped and thus, not included in the output waves.

The output data varies depending on the requested type.

range:
Each output data wave is numeric and contains two elements with the start and end time of the epoch in [ms].

name:
Each output data wave is textual and contains one elements with the full name of the epoch.

treelevel:
Each output data wave is numeric with one element with the tree level of the epoch.

The returned data type is `SF_DATATYPE_EPOCHS`.
The default suggested x-axis values for the formula plotter are sweep numbers. The suggested y-axis label is the type requested (`name`, `tree level`, `range`).

.. code-block:: bash

   // get stimset range (epoch ST) from all displayed sweeps and channels
   epochs(ST)

   // two sweeps acquired with two headstages set with PulseTrain_100Hz_DA_0 and PulseTrain_150Hz_DA_0 from _2017_09_01_192934-compressed.nwb
   epochs(ST, select(channels(AD), sweeps()), range) == [[20, 1376.01], [20, 1342.67], [20, 1376.01], [20, 1342.67]]

tp
""

The `tp` operation returns analysis values for test pulses that are part of selected sweeps.

.. code-block:: bash

   tp(operation mode[, array selectData[, array ignoreTPs]])

The mode argument sets what test pulse analysis is run.
The following tp analysis modes are supported:

``tpbase()`` Returns the baseline level in pA or mV depending on the clamp mode.

``tpinst()`` Returns the instantaneous resistance values in MÎ©.

``tpss()`` Returns the steady state resistance values in MÎ©.

``tpfit(string fitFunc, string retValue[, variable maxTrail])`` Returns results from fitting the test pulse range.

See specific subsections for more details.

The second argument is a selection of sweeps and channels where the test pulse information is retrieved from.
It must be specified through the `select` operation.
When the optional second argument is omitted, `select()` is used as default that includes all displayed sweeps and channels.

The optional argument ``ignoreTPs`` allows to ignore some of the found test-pulses. The indices are zero-based and identify the
test-pulses by ascending starting time.

If a single sweep contains multiple test pulses then the data from the test
pulses is averaged before analysis. The included test pulses in a single sweep must have the same duration.

The operation returns multiple data waves. There is one data wave returned for each sweep/channel selected through selectData.
The sweep and channel meta data is included in each data wave.

The returned data type is `SF_DATATYPE_TP`.
The default suggested x-axis values for the formula plotter are sweep numbers. The suggested y-axis label is the unit of the analysis value (`pA`, `mV`, `MÎ©`).

Test pulses that are part of sweeps are identified through their respective epoch short name, that starts with "TP" or "U_TP".
If in selectData nothing is selected the number of returned data waves is zero.
If a selected sweep does not contain any test pulse then for that data wave a null wave is returned.

.. code-block:: bash

   // Get steady state resistance from all displayed sweeps and channels
   tp(tpss())

   // Get steady state resistance from all displayed sweeps and AD channels
   tp(tpss(), select(channels(AD), sweeps()))

   // Get base line level from all displayed sweeps and DA1 channel
   tp(tpbase(), select(channels(DA1), sweeps()))

   // Get base line level from all displayed sweeps and channels ignoring test pulse 0 and 1
   tp(tpbase(), select(), [0, 1])

   // Fit the test pulse from all displayed sweeps and channels exponentially and show the amplitude.
   tp(tpfit(exp, amp))

   // Fit the test pulse from all displayed sweeps and channels double-exponentially and show the smaller tau from the two exponentials.
   // The fitting range is changed from the default maximum of 250 ms to 500 ms if the next epoch is sufficiently long.
   tp(tpfit(doubleexp, tausmall, 500))

tpbase
======

The tpbase operation specifies an operation mode for the tp operation.
In that mode the tp operation returns the baseline level in pA or mV depending on the clamp mode.
tpbase uses a fixed algorithm and takes no arguments.

tpss
====

The tpss operation specifies an operation mode for the tp operation.
In that mode the tp operation returns the steady state resistance values in MÎ©.
tpss uses a fixed algorithm and takes no arguments.

tpinst
======

The tpinst operation specifies an operation mode for the tp operation.
In that mode the tp operation returns the instantaneous resistance values in MÎ©.
tpinst uses a fixed algorithm and takes no arguments.

tpfit
=====

The tpfit operation specifies an operation mode for the tp operation.
In that mode the tp operation fits data from test pulses with the specified fit function template and returns the specified fit result value.
By default the fit range includes the epoch that follows after the test pulse limited up to 250 ms. Whichever ends first. The default time limit can be overwritten with
the third argument.

.. code-block:: bash

   tpfit(string fitFunc, string retValue[, variable maxTrail])

The first argument is the name of a fit function, valid fit functions are ``exp`` and ``doubleexp``.
The fit function ``exp`` applies the fit: :math:`y = K_0+K_1*e^{-\frac{x-x_0}{K_2}}`.
The fit function ``doubleexp`` applies the fit: :math:`y = K_0+K_1*e^{-\frac{x-x_0}{K_2}}+K_3*e^{-\frac{x-x_0}{K_4}}`.

The second argument specifies the value returned from the fit function. Options are ``tau``, ``tausmall``, ``amp``, ``minabsamp`` and ``fitq``.
The option ``tau`` returns for the fit function ``exp`` the coefficient :math:`K_2`, for ``doubleexp`` it returns :math:`max(K_2, K_4)`.
The option ``tausmall`` returns for the fit function ``exp`` the coefficient :math:`K_2`, for ``doubleexp`` it returns :math:`min(K_2, K_4)`.
The option ``amp`` returns for the fit function ``exp`` the coefficient :math:`K_1`, for ``doubleexp`` it returns :math:`K_1` if :math:`max(|K_1|, |K_3|) = |K_1|`, :math:`K_3` otherwise.
The option ``minabsamp`` returns for the fit function ``exp`` the coefficient :math:`K_1`, for ``doubleexp`` it returns :math:`K_1` if :math:`min(|K_1|, |K_3|) = |K_1|`, :math:`K_3` otherwise.
The option ``fitq`` returns the fit quality defined as :math:`\sum_0^n{(y_i-y_{fit})^2}/(x_n-x_0)`.

The optional third argument specifies the time in [ms] after the test pulse that is maximal included in the input data for the fit, typically from the next epoch.
By default if the next epoch on tree level 1 is sufficiently long 250 ms of sweep data is included in the fit.

log
"""

The `log` operation prints the first element of input wave to the command line but
passes the wave transparently to the next operation. It is useful for debugging
inside large formulas.

The operation accepts also multiple data waves as first argument.
For this case the operation is applied on each input data wave independently and returns the same number of data waves.

If the input wave is empty, then log prints nothing and the number of data waves returned is zero.

.. code-block:: bash

   // outputs "1" to the history area
   log(1, 10, 100) == [1, 10, 100]

log10
"""""

The `log10` operation applies the decadic (base 10) logarithm to its input.

The operation accepts also multiple data waves as first argument.
For this case the operation is applied on each input data wave independently and returns the same number of data waves.

.. code-block:: bash

   log10(1, 10, 100) == [0,1,2]

store
"""""

The `store` operation stores data in the labnotebook.

.. code-block:: bash

   store(string name, array data)

name
  name suffix for the labnotebook entry. The full entry name is  "Sweep Formula store [name]" without brackets.

data
  a data wave. Currently multiple data waves are not supported as input.

The entries are written to the textual results wave for documentation purposes and
later querying. The second parameter which can be any numerical/textual array
is serialized and stored under the given name.

The operation returns the data argument unchanged.

.. code-block:: bash

   store("fancy feature", [10, 100])

adds the entry "Sweep Formula store [fancy feature]" with a serialized version of given array.

Plotting
^^^^^^^^

When clicking the `Display` button in the SF tab the formula gets parsed, executed and
the result plotted. Evaluating the JSON object from the Formula Parser through the Formula Executor
gives a resulting wave.
For each data wave, the data from the rows is plotted as traces and the columns and layers
are evaluated as an array of traces. Thus, a single plotted trace is created by the following input:
`1, 2, 3, 4, 5`. Two traces with 5 data points each are created by this input:
`[1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5, 7]`. Whereas the input `0...10, 20...30` creates
ten traces with two data points each, starting with the first trace X = 0, Y = 0; X = 1, Y = 20.

In typical use cases instead of explicitly writing static data in the formula the data
operation is utilized that returns data in the correct layout.

The plotter parses the meta data from data waves as well. For suitable data types
trace colors and legend annotations are associated automatically. Operations can suggest x-values and x-axis labels to the plotter.
If the user has not specified a formula for the x-values then the plotter uses the suggested x-values instead.

If the formula results returns a null wave as wave reference wave an error is generated by the formula plotter.
If the formula results contains data waves that are null waves they are skipped by the formula plotter.

Plotting Text Waves
"""""""""""""""""""

The formula plotter supports that the y-data or the x-data can be a 1d-text-wave. The other wave must be numeric.
2d-text-waves are not supported for plotting.

Separate X-values
"""""""""""""""""

Sometimes it is useful to explicitly specify X values for a series of data values.
Therefore, two formulas can be plotted against each other by using the vs operator.

.. code-block:: bash

   0...10 vs range(10, 100, 10)

gives

.. figure:: svg/sweepFormulaPlot.svg
   :align: center

Note that in this example there are 10 Y-values and only 9 X-values returned by the
respective formula part. The resulting graph shows 9 data points and thus does not show
data points where either an X or Y value for the X, Y value pair is missing.

The plotter supports the same X-values for multiple traces:

.. code-block:: bash

   [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5, 7] vs 1...6

.. figure:: ScreenShots/sweepFormulaPlot2.png
   :align: center

This example plots two traces with five data points each against equidistant
X coordinates 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The first trace is colored blue for demonstration.
This also works for a constant X value and multiple traces.
The same way separate X value series for traces can be set:

.. code-block:: bash

   [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5, 7] vs [1, 0], [2, 0.5], [3, 1], [4, 1.5], [5, 2]

.. figure:: ScreenShots/sweepFormulaPlot3.png
   :align: center

The above example plots two traces with the first one Y series: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; X series: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and the second Y series: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; X series: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.
The first trace is colored blue for demonstration.

There is one special case where given X-values are not applied for every trace. If the following conditions
apply then the n-th value of the given X-values is used for the n-th trace:

- there is the same amount of Y-data-waves as points in the X-wave
- the Y-wave for a trace contains only one data point

.. code-block:: bash

   min(data(TP,select(channels(AD0), 4...11,all)))
   vs
   1...8

In the example the select operation selects channel AD0 from sweep 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Thus, the data operation returns exactly 8 data waves with sweep data.
Therefore, the min operation returns 8 data waves with exactly one data point. With the specified X-wave that also contains 8 points
the first data wave from min gets the first value of the X-wave paired, the second data wave from min gets the second value of the X-wave paired a.s.o.

Multiple graphs
"""""""""""""""

Several graphs can generated with a single input by separating the formulas
with `and`. The `and` must be on an own line.

.. code-block:: bash

   0...10 vs range(10, 100, 10)
   and
   10...20 vs range(10, 100, 10)
   and
   20...30

The above code creates a panel with three separate graphs arranged vertically evenly spaced.

.. figure:: ScreenShots/sweepFormulaPlot4.png
   :align: center

Multiple Y-Formulas
"""""""""""""""""""

Several y-formulas can be plotted with the keyword `with`. The `with` must be on an own line between the y-formulas.
If the y-data contains different data units the y-axis will show all data units separated by `/`.

.. code-block:: bash

   0...10
   with
   20...30
    vs range(10, 100, 10)
   and
   10...20
   with
   30...40
   with
   40...50
    vs range(10, 100, 10)
   and
   20...30

Getting Quick Help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Sweep Formula notebook it is possible to get a quick help for operation and keywords like `vs` and `and`.
Mark the operation in question with the mouse and hover over it, a tooltip appears that shows the help for this operation.
Alternatively hold shift and right-click to jump to the `Help` tab that shows the help for the marked operation.

Writing Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following sketches some templates to write an operation.

Generally the JSON must not be parsed by the operation itself, but the wrapper functions have to be used.

Steps:

- Get and check the number of arguments.
- Retrieve and check all mandatory arguments. Use `SF_GetArgument` for arguments that can consist of multiple data waves and `SF_GetArgumentSingle` for arguments that are expected to return only a single data wave.
- Retrieve all optional arguments from last to first and set for each a default value of not present. (see also operation code for `setscale`)
- Create a output waveRef wave with `SF_CreateSFRefWave` of the correct size.
- Execute the operation calculation, typically for each input data wave independently.
- Be aware that a data wave might be a null wave, check sanity of input data wave, tranfer scales from input to calculation result if possible
- Handle the Meta data, set a data type and transfer the wave notes on demand.
- Return the operation result(s) through `SF_GetOutputForExecutor` or `SF_GetOutputForExecutorSingle` if the operation has only a single data wave as result.
- Add the data type handling in `SF_GetTraceColor` and `SF_GetMetaDataAnnotationText` for proper trace colors and legend annotations in the formula plotter.

Example code for a typical operation taking three arguments, the first argument is some kind of input data.

.. code-block:: igorpro

Example code for an operation taking the top array as input data. The specific difference here is that we use a convention that if there
is only a single argument then we parse it as it could possibly an argument with multiple data waves. If it is just regular data then it is converted
to a single data wave with one element and thus, stays compatible with the `SF_GetArgumentTop` parsing, if that would have encountered a single element.
This allows to put output from e.g. `data` directly in such an operation as first argument. The operation works then on each data wave separately.

The function `SF_TransferFormulaDataWaveNoteAndMeta` transfers the meta information and wave notes of the reference and data waves.
It also updates the operation stack information. There are two cases where `SF_TransferFormulaDataWaveNoteAndMeta` can not be used:

- The operation does not take an input reference wave
- The operation returns data through `SF_GetOutputForExecutorSingle` that creates the reference wave.

For operation that do not take an input reference wave that is calculated to an output reference wave the approach is to update the operation stack
meta information directly through `JWN_SetStringInWaveNote(output, SF_META_OPSTACK, AddListItem(SF_OP_OPSHORT, ""))`.
If `SF_GetOutputForExecutorSingle` is called then the optional parameter `opStack` should be set to the previous operation stack. For operations like
`sweeps()` there is no previous operation, thus the parameter would be `opStack=""`.

It should be noted that there is a difference for parsing a single first argument through `SF_GetArgument` or `SF_GetArgumentTop`.
`SF_GetArgument` starts execution for argument 0 specifically at the `/0` JSON path location, whereas `SF_GetArgumentTop` starts execution at `/`.
Set the case that the first argument is `wave(pathToWave)` with a 1d-wave containing a single element with value `17`.
`SF_GetArgument` executes the `wave` operation first, whereas `SF_GetArgumentTop` executes the array `[wave(pathToWave)]` first.
Thus, `SF_GetArgument` sees with the resolved `wave` operation `[17]`, whereas `SF_GetArgumentTop` sees `[[17]]`. Therefore the first returns a
`{17}` wave and the latter a `{{17}}` wave.

More complex operation such as `data` build the output wave reference wave dynamically. See `SF_GetSweepsForFormula` how the output wave is build depending on selectData and the found sweeps.

Meta Data Handling
""""""""""""""""""

Operation as well as the formula plotter can evaluate returned meta data from the result wave(s). Generally meta data is set through JSON wave notes.
Data wave independent meta data is set in the wave ref wave, whereas data wave dependent data is set as note of the data wave(s) itself.
Currently certain key constants for meta data fields are defined.

For the wave ref wave:

- SF_META_DATATYPE: string, data type of operation result (some operations are transparent for that)
- SF_META_XAXISLABEL: string, suggested label for the x-axis for the plotter, typically combined with x-value meta data in the data wave(s)
- SF_META_YAXISLABEL: string, suggested label for the y-axis for the plotter
- SF_META_OPSTACK: string, tracks the operation stack

For the data wave(s):

- SF_META_SWEEPNO: number, number of the sweep that provided the source data
- SF_META_CHANNELTYPE: number, channel type from the sweep that provided the source data
- SF_META_CHANNELNUMBER: number, channel number from the sweep that provided the source data
- SF_META_XVALUES: wave, suggested x-wave for the plotter to display this data wave

See also `SF_OperationLabnotebookImpl`, where such meta data is set.

The function `SF_TransferFormulaDataWaveNoteAndMeta` transfers meta data from one operation to the next.
If the following conditions are met then a suggested X-values are set in the meta data:

- The input data type is SF_DATATYPE_SWEEP and all output data waves have no wave units for x set and all output data waves have only one data point -> sweep number is set as X-value and "Sweeps" as x label
- For any not above specified input data type: if all output data wave have one data point and all output data waves have no wave units for x set and the input data wave has a sweep number value set in the meta data ->  sweep number is set as X-value and "Sweeps" as x label

.. code-block:: bash

   min(
     butterworth(
       integrate(
         derivative(
           data(TP,select(channels(AD0), 4...11,all))
         )
       )
     ,4,100,4)
   )

In the above example the data operation sets sweep number as meta data. The `SF_TransferFormulaDataWaveNoteAndMeta` function transfers that meta data also to the results of the outer operations.
The data waves returned from the min operation contain only a single data point and the result complies with the second set of conditions mentioned above. Thus, the results are
displayed in the plotter with sweep numbers on the x-axis and "Sweeps" as x-label.

Operation Stack
"""""""""""""""

The operation stack meta data is updated in the called operation, typically through `SF_TransferFormulaDataWaveNoteAndMeta`.
It is a semicolon separated list of operations called for a single formula, where the most recent operation is at the front of the list.
Operations where data from several sources is joined, like `plus` discard the previous operation stack. Thus, the operation stack contains
only operations that were relevant for the strands of data that reaches ultimately the formula plotter.
The operation stack information is used to create the trace legend(s) in the graph(s) as well as for the trace names.
Also the trace color is determined through evaluation of the operation stack. For example, only if the operation stack indicates that the most recent data
originated from a `data()` operation without intermediate operations that break this data strand, such as `+`, then the meta iformation about sweep data is taken to
determine the traces color.
