[6](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65482)\] sweep based data acquisition
software package for intracellular electrophysiology (patch clamp). It offers
top of its class flexibility and robustness for stimulus generation, data
acquisition, and analysis.

## Highlights

- Acquire data on up to eight headstage on a single DAC.
- Run up to five DACs in parallel.
- Create arbitrarily complex stimulus sets with an easy to use GUI
- Export all data, including all of its metadata, into the industry-standard NWBv2-format and read it back in
- Run custom code during data acquisition for Automatic Experiment Control
- Completely automate the experimental setup using JSON configuration files
- Interact with MIES from other programming languages (Python, C++, Javascript, ...) using ZeroMQ.
- Comprehensive experimental metadata acquisition and browsing tools
- Use the integrated scripting language for convenient on-the-fly data evaluation.
- Fully backward compatible with every earlier MIES version
